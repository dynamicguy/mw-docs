## What is MajorityWorld?

MajorityWorld is an e-commerce platform for building online stores. Create great-looking client interfaces which have all the features that provide modern, rich shopping experiences. Make use of an administration dashboard that allows you to easily manage products, people, and functionalities. MajorityWorld has solutions for small, midsize, and enterprise-level retailers and covers both physical and digital inventory.

One major advantage of MajorityWorld is that it is available as both a typical online store and as a PWA application. PWA means that your customers can download your store to any device and browse it offline or when they have no internet access. They can also make orders and payments just like when shopping online.

MajorityWorldâ€™s open source platform is free to use in its full version. It has clean and simple code, written in Python and JavaScript on a Django framework, with a GraphQL API. You can find out everything you need to know about the technology base of MajorityWorld from our developer documentation.
