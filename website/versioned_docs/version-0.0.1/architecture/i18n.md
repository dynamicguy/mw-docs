## Translation

MajorityWorld uses `gettext` for translation. This is an industry standard for translating software and is the most common way to translate Django applications.

MajorityWorld’s storefront and dashboard are both prepared for translation. They use separate translation domains and can be translated separately. All translations provide accurate context descriptions to make translation an easier task.

It is possible to translate database content (like product descriptions) with MajorityWorld, more on it can be found in the [Translations](/mw-docs/docs/dashboard/translations) section.


## Localization

### Data formats

MajorityWorld uses [Babel](http://babel.pocoo.org/en/latest/) as the interface to Unicode’s CLDR library to provide accurate number and date formatting as well as proper currency designation.


### Address forms

[Google’s address format database](https://github.com/dynamicguy/google-i18n-address) is used to provide locale-specific address formats and forms. It also takes care of address validation so you don’t have to know how to address a package to China or whether United Arab Emirates use postal codes (_they don’t_).


### Currency conversion

MajorityWorld can use currency exchange rate data to show price estimations in the visitor’s local currency. Please consult [Open Exchange Rates](/mw-docs/docs/integrations/openexchangerates) for how to set this up for [Open Exchange Rates](https://openexchangerates.org/).


### Phone numbers format

MajorityWorld uses [Google’s `libphonenumber` library](https://github.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber) to ensure provided numbers are correct. You need to choose prefix and type the number separately. No matter what country has been chosen, you may enter phone number belonging to any other country format.
